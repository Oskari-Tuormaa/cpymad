Other distributions
===================

If you want to use another python installation things will get more
complicated. I recommend the following resources:

* MinGW_, since you need a compiler to build *libmadx* and *CPyMAD*
* `Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages`_
* `Compiling Python extensions with distutils and MinGW`_


.. _MinGW: http://www.mingw.org/
.. _Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
.. _Compiling Python extensions with distutils and MinGW: http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2008/06/28/compiling-python-extensions-with-distutils-and-mingw/
