Windows
-------

On a windows platform, you are likely to run into more problems than on
linux when building from source. Therefore, I will try to provide `built
versions`_ for some platforms. If your platform is supported, you can just
run

.. code-block:: bat

    pip install cpymad

from your terminal and that's it. If there is no binary available for your
platform you ask me via email or the github issue pages if I can create one
for you.

If you want to build from source, have a look at the following guides:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   pythonxy
   winpython
   other


.. _built versions: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cpymad/
