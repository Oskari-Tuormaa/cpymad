Installation
************

In order to install cpymad, please try::

    pip install cpymad --only-binary cpymad

If this fails, it usually means that we haven't uploaded wheels for your
platform or python version. In this case, either `ping us`_ about adding a
corresponding wheel, or refer to the :ref:`building-from-source` guide.

Note that it is recommended to use python 3.6 or later. Support for old python
versions will be phased out when they are no longer officially supported.
